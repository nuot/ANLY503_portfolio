Hello, welcome to my data visualization course final portfolio!


There includes a few examples that I did in the past semester, and also my final project.
The final project is the study for real estates. It demonstrates how the housing distribute in a certain area; how the year each 
architecture built affects the land value and taxes; which counties have preference of hand making homes, etc. It would be useful
as a add-on part of any real estate price predicion tasks. 

Thank you!
